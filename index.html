<b> The World Wide Web </b> <br>
The World Wide Web is a collection of document pages stored on computers called servers.  Indivual computers can access Web pages through the internet using http.  The <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> Udacity  Video </a>  provides a nice introduction to the web. Also this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"> Wikipedia page<a/a> provides a historical overview. <br>
<b>HTML</b> <br>
HTML is the coding language that most of the pages on the web are written in.  The full name for HTML is hypertext markup language.  <br>
Tags are shortcuts that tell the browser how to display a page. Html is written by having an opening tag, then the contents and then the closing tag.  Tags can be <b>inline </b> such as <em> a, span, br, ing, stong </em> or <b> block </b> <em> div, p, form </em>.  Inline means the code works within the line and block means it draws an invisible block around the text.  <br>
<b>Stupid Computers</b><br>
Another main point to remember is that computers take everything literal. A little typo can mess up the entire page. <br>
